## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by the project maintainers.
2. Submit your report privately to our team by emailing [aspedm@gmail.com](mailto:aspedm@gmail.com).
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce and any potential impact.
4. Our security team will review your report and respond as soon as possible with any necessary actions or updates.
5. Once the vulnerability has been confirmed and addressed, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution, if desired, after the issue has been resolved.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure. Thank you for your responsible disclosure and cooperation.
